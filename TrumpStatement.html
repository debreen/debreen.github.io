<h3>President Trump Delivers Remarks on Charlie Kirk - September 10, 2025</h3>

To my great fellow Americans, I am filled with grief and anger at the
heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah.
<br>
Charlie inspired millions, and tonight all who knew him and loved him
are united in shock and horror.<br>
Charlie was a patriot who devoted his
life to the cause of open debate and the country that he loved so much,
the United States of America.<br>
He fought for liberty, democracy, justice, 
and the American people. He's a martyr for truth and freedom.<br>
And there's
never been anyone who was so respected by youth.<br>
Charlie was also a man
of deep, deep faith. And we take comfort in the knowledge that he is now
at peace with God in heaven.<br>
Our prayers are with his wife Erica, the two
young beloved children, and his entire family who he loved more than
anything in the world.<br>
We ask God to watch over them in this terrible
hour of heartache and pain.
