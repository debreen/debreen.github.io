From <i>Oppenheimer:</i><br>
Niels Bohr: Algebra's like sheet music. The
important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?<br>
Robert Oppenheimer: I can.
<p>
From <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> by Ayn Rand.<br>
Eddie Willers had said, "Whatever is right," twenty-two years ago. He had
kept that statement unchallenged ever since. But he still thought it
self-evident that one had to do what was right; <br>
he had never learned how
people could want to do otherwise; he had learned only that they did.
It still seemed simple and incomprehensible to him: simple that things
should be right, <br>and incomprehensible that they weren't.
He knew that they weren't.
