<h3>Charlie Kirk Remarks on 2nd Amendment - 2023</h3>

So, we need to be very clear that you're not going to get gun deaths to zero.
It will not happen.<br>
You can significantly reduce them by having more
fathers at home.<br>
Yes. By having more armed guards in front of schools.<br>
We should have a honest and clear reductionist view of gun violence,
but we should not have a utopian one.<br>
You will never live in a society
when you have an armed citizenry and you won't have a single gun death.<br>
That is nonsense. It's dribble. But I think it's worth it.<br>
I think it's
worth to have a cost of unfortunately some gun deaths every single year
so that we can have<br>
the Second Amendment to protect our other god-given rights.
